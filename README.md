# SQL---Filtering-Sorting

In this repository, I have shared my understanding of the SQL Queries of Filtering & Sorting by Using Operators and Keywords like (BETWEEN, IN,LIKE, DISTINCT)
What have I Learned from Filtering & Sorting?
1. IN Operator : Its an Alternative to OR Condition
2. BETWEEN: It works with Number, Dates, and texts. And it is used to filter values within a specific range.
3. LIKE: Pattern matching in text based searches. % Represents zero or more characters & _ Represents exactly one character.
4. DISTINCT: To remove duplicate Values.
